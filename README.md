## Compressive Sensing signal and image reconstruction with Feedforward Artificial Neural Network

There are three different executable scripts in repository:
- csffann.py - 1-D - signal reconstruction
- csimg.py - training of network for cameraman image reconstrucation
- ceval.py - evaluation of model trained by csimg.py

To test model in this repository run cseval.py as follows:
```
python3 cseval.py
```
